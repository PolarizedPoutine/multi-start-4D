# Conventions
A list of conventions I follow in this code.

## Momentum vectors
The momentum vectors will always be in the order CCHH.

## Z-matrix
For 4-ion acetylene the [Z-matrix] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-matrix_(chemistry))
has 6 parameters. I will always call these individual parameters r12, r23, r34,
theta13, theta24, and phi.
